                                    Sushant Singh Rajput was born in Maldiha in the Purnia district of Bihar to Krishna Kumar Singh and Usha Singh. One of his sisters, Mitu Singh, is a state-level cricketer. His mother's death in 2002 left Rajput devastated and it was in the same year that the family moved from Patna to Delhi

                                    Rajput attended a St. Karen's High School in Patna and  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kulachi_Hansraj_Model_School">Kulachi Hansraj Model School</a> in New Delhi. According to Rajput, he had ranked seventh in the DCE Entrance Exam in 2003, and secured admission in the Bachelor of Engineering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering">(Mechanical Engineering)</a> class in Delhi College of Engineering. He was also a National Olympiad Winner in Physics. In all, he cleared as many as 11 engineering entrance exams, including that for the Indian School of Mines. After he started participating in theatre and dance, he rarely had time for studies, resulting in several backlogs which ultimately made him leave DCE. He completed only three years of the four-year course before dropping out to pursue an acting career.

                                <p> While a student at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Technological_University">Delhi Technological University</a> , Rajput enrolled in Shiamak Davar's dance classes.[20] It was only later that the idea of making a career in acting came to him, as some of his fellow students in the dance classes happened to be interested in acting and was attending <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_John_%28theatre_director%29">Barry John's</a> drama classes. Influenced by them, Rajput also joined the acting classes. Here, he found his passion for acting: <span class="sushant-quote">"I found the experience liberating. I realised that I could communicate with the audience. I knew I wanted to do this forever."</span>

                                Within a few months of joining the dance class, Rajput was selected to be a member of Davar's standard dance troupe. In 2005, he was chosen to be one of the groups of background dancers at the 51st <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmfare_Awards">Filmfare Awards.</a> In 2006, he was part of the troupe that went to Australia to perform in the cultural programme at the opening ceremony of the 2006 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games">Commonwealth Games.</a> By this time, he was tired of engineering. He was happy and successful in the dance and drama classes and decided to do what he was good at. He dropped out of engineering and devoted himself full-time to dancing and acting.
                                    
                                To make a break into films, Rajput moved to Mumbai and joined Nadira Babbar's Ekjute theatre group, which he remained a part of for two and a half years. During this time, he was featured in a TV advertisement for Nestlé Munch, which became famous throughout India.
